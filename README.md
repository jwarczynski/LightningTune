# LightningTune

A PyTorch Lightning project for efficient model training and hyperparameter optimization using Optuna. Supports model monitoring with Weights & Biases (wandb) or MLflow.

## Overview

This project leverages **PyTorch Lightning** for streamlined model training and **Optuna** for hyperparameter tuning. To keep track of training metrics, you can monitor experiments using **Weights & Biases** (wandb).
